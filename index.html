   <h3>About Le Sserafim</h3>

    Le Sserafim debuted on May 2, 2022, with the extended play Fearless. It was followed in October with their second extended play,
     Antifragile, which became the group's first release to sell over a million copies and made them the fastest K-pop girl group to debut on the US Billboard 200 at the time.

    The album's singles "Unforgiven" and "Eve, Psyche & the Bluebeard's Wife" peaked at number two in South Korea and were certified gold for streaming in Japan. 
    The group's first English single "Perfect Night" (2023) became their first number-one song on the Circle Digital Chart, topping the chart for six weeks.
